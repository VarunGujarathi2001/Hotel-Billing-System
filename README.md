The "Hotel Billing System" is a cutting-edge project that aims to revolutionize the way hotels manage their billing and order processing operations. Traditionally, hotels have relied on printed menu cards, which are prone to damage and cumbersome to update. This project addresses these challenges by introducing an online billing system that can efficiently take orders and generate bills automatically. By adopting this system, hotels can improve their overall appearance and reduce manual efforts in collecting orders, while also offering a more convenient experience for their customers.

The core objective of the project is to design and implement an online hotel billing system using Java and MySQL. This system streamlines the billing process by allowing customers to place orders and receive bills through a touchless interface. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, contactless service has become a necessity, and this project addresses that need by providing a safe and hygienic billing solution. The system enables customers to access the hotel's menu digitally, choose their preferred items, and place orders without any physical contact with menu cards or staff members.

By integrating Java and MySQL, the project achieves automation in order processing and bill generation. The user-friendly interface allows the hotel staff to easily manage the menu by adding or removing items and updating prices. With an organized and efficient backend powered by MySQL, the system stores and retrieves customer information and billing data securely. Moreover, the system offers a seamless experience to the customers, ensuring that the billing process is quick, accurate, and hassle-free.

In addition to the technical aspects, the project considers the broader context of the hospitality industry. It focuses on enhancing customer experience by offering a touchless and modernized billing process. As the project is future-oriented, it has the potential for further development, such as implementing the system for the Android platform. By embracing technology and innovation, the "Hotel Billing System" aims to meet the ever-evolving needs of the hotel industry, ensuring efficiency, safety, and customer satisfaction in the dining experience.
